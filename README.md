# **Niraj Rayamajhi**

Hello! 👋  

I’m a postdoctoral research scholar working with Dr. [Ying Li](https://www.purdue.edu/hla/sites/lilab/) and Dr. [Jing Gao](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~jinggao/).
Currently, I work on **application of Artificial Intelligence on crop genomes for decoding information on gene regulations**.

I had also worked as postdoctoral researcher with Dr. [Susanne Pfeifer's Lab](http://spfeiferlab.org/) at Arizona State University (ASU). 
At ASU, I built a pipeline for identification and characterization as well as genotyping of structural variation in biomedically-relevant primates using long-read (HiFi) sequencing approach (for gaining insights on genetic differences between diseased and non-diseased populations of sub-species, Papio anubis and Papio hamadryas)

I earned my PhD under Dr. [Julian Catchen](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 
During my Ph.D., I focused on **bioinformatics** as well as **comparative and population genomics** of secondarily temperate *Paranotothenia angustata*, commonly known as New Zealand black cod. Additionally, I worked on the **genomics of highly cold-specialized fish**, *Trematomus borchgrevinki*, which is endemic to Antarctica. 

I had completed my master’s degree in Dr. [Jyotsna Sharma's lab](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/pss/sharma-lab/index.php) at Texas Tech University.
In my master's research, I explored the **genetic diversity and structure** of a rare endemic cactus and assessed its genetic relationship with a more common congener.
