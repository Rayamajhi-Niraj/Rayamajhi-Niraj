# **Niraj Rayamajhi**

Hello! üëã  

I‚Äôm a postdoctoral research scholar in Dr. [Susanne Pfeifer's Lab](http://spfeiferlab.org/) at Arizona State University. 
I earned my PhD under Dr. [Julian Catchen](https://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and completed my master‚Äôs degree in 
Dr. [Jyotsna Sharma's lab](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/pss/sharma-lab/index.php) at Texas Tech University.

Currently, I'm investigating the **causes and consequences of structural variation** in biomedically relevant primates using cutting-edge sequencing data. 

During my PhD, I focused on the **comparative and population genomics** of secondarily temperate *Paranotothenia angustata*, commonly known as New Zealand black cod.
Additionally, I worked on the **genomics of highly cold-specialized fish**, *Trematomus borchgrevinki*, which is endemic to Antarctica. 

In my master's research, I explored the **genetic diversity and structure** of a rare endemic cactus and assessed its genetic relationship with a more common congener.
